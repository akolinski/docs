## Introduction

Some text.

### Search engine optimisation (SEO)

### Caching

### jQuery or Vue

Did you know that you can incorporate Vue into your project the same way that you would incorporate jQuery. In this <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/jquery-vue-javascript/' target='_blank'>article</a> they provide examples for capturing user inputs, storing user inputs, toggling classes, hiding and showing and submitting forms.

It is definitely ok to use jQuery if it suits you! Vue is also a pretty nice abstraction for small sites that don’t need a lot of overhead. Vue is comparable in size, easy to reason about, and it’s fairly trivial to switch small pieces of functionality to Vue without rewriting your HTML in JavaScript.

Due to Vue’s flexibility, it’s also easy to transition this code to a build step and component structures if you’d like to adopt a more complex structure over time. The nice thing about the flexibility to choose either way of incorporating Vue into your project means that you’re not pressed to change your style of working all at once, and you can even make changes slowly over time. This is why people call Vue the progressive framework.

### ExpressionEngine

Having a thin PHP layer to still use what we have in place.
