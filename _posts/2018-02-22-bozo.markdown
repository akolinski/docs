### COD WW2 Policy

In order for a player to achieve this vote from the committee members the 'newbie' must beat the clan member with the highest rank. The 'newbie' to beat the clan member in the first to 3 separate wins - 1v1 pit games. These will only be held if all members are present in the headquarters to watch, and only when the ranking clan member choose to. This can only be attempted once per week per "newbie".
